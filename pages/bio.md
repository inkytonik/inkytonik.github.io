I have been researching programming languages and software language engineering for more than twenty years.
I have made particular contributions to the design and implementation of small languages that bring domain expertise to bear on software challenges, including as a co-author of the main survey paper in the area: [When and how to develop domain-specific languages](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1118890.1118892) in ACM Computing Surveys.

I'm the lead designer and developer of the [Kiama language processing library](/projects/kiama) for Scala that applies domain-specific techniques to the rapid development of language implementations.
I'm the lead of the [Cooma project](/projects/cooma) funded by Oracle Labs Australia that is investigating pure, functional language design based on fine-grained object capabilities.
My work on the [Skink Software Verification Tool](/projects/skink) with [Franck Cassez](https://au.linkedin.com/in/franck-cassez-b775807) focuses on applying [Kiama](/projects/kiama), [sbt-rats](/projects/sbtrats), SMT solvers and related libraries to build an automatic program verifier for LLVM with applications to correctness and security.

Previously, I was one of the designers and developers of the [Eli compiler generation system](/projects/eli) which uses high-level domain-specific languages as specifications.
