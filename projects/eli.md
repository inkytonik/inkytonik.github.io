# Eli Compiler Generation System

Efficient language processors ranging from simple DSL implementations to full compilers can be automatically generated from high-level declarative specifications.

Eli is in maintenance mode and is not actively being developed.
Most of the current work on language processors at Macquarie is based on the [Kiama library](projects/kiama).
